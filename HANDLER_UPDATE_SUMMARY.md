# Handler Update Summary

## Investigation Results

### Handlers Checked
All media handlers were reviewed to ensure they work with only `media_id` parameter (no `link` requirement):

1. **`/api/v1/media/links` (POST)** - `GetLinkList`
   - ✅ Already expects `content_id` instead of link
   - Uses `GetLinkListRequest` with `ContentID` field

2. **`/api/v1/media/get` (POST)** - `GetLinkMedia`
   - ✅ Already works with only `media_id`
   - Uses `GetLinkMediaRequest` with `MediaID` field only

3. **`/api/v1/media/get` (PUT)** - `UpdateLinkMedia`
   - ✅ Already works with only `media_id`
   - Uses `UpdateMediaRequest` with `MediaID` field only

4. **`/api/v1/media/get` (DELETE)** - `DeleteLinkMedia`
   - ✅ Already works with only `media_id`
   - Uses `DeleteMediaRequest` with `MediaID` field only

5. **`/api/v1/media/getDirect` (POST)** - `GetLinkMediaURI`
   - ✅ Already works with only `media_id`
   - Uses `GetLinkMediaURIRequest` with `MediaID` field only

### Issues Found and Fixed

1. **PostID → ContentID References**
   - Fixed in `/internal/api/handlers/posts.go`:
     - Line 68: Changed `PostID: post.PostID` to `ContentID: post.ContentID`
     - Line 125: Changed `PostID: post.PostID` to `ContentID: post.ContentID`
   
2. **Model Updates**
   - `AddPostResponse` struct already had `ContentID` field (was correct)
   - `PostListItem` struct already had `ContentID` field (was correct)

3. **Swagger Documentation**
   - Regenerated to reflect all changes
   - All endpoints now properly document the use of `content_id` and `media_id`

### Response Models Still Containing "link" Field
The following response models still include a "link" field for backward compatibility:
- `MediaListResponse` - includes both `content_id` and `link`
- `PostListItem` - includes both `content_id` and `link`

These can be removed in a future update if backward compatibility is not required.

## Conclusion
All handlers are already properly configured to work with only `media_id` (no link requirement). The only updates needed were to change `PostID` references to `ContentID` in the posts handler, which have been completed.
